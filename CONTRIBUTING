# Contributing to Vulkan Video Samples

Thank you for your interest in contributing! All contributions should be submitted through pull requests. If you're implementing a new feature, we encourage you to add unit tests using the [testing framework](tests/README.md).

---

## Commit Message Guidelines

All commit messages must follow this format:

```
scope: description
```

### Scope

The scope identifies the area of the codebase being changed:

- **Lowercase** for general areas: `cmake`, `ci`, `docs`, `build`
- **PascalCase** for components: `VkVideoDecoder`, `VkEncoderConfig`, `FindShaderc`
- **Braces** for multiple components: `VkEncoderConfig{H264,H265}`

### Rules

- **Header length**: Maximum 100 characters
- **Subject**: Must not be empty, must not end with a period
- **No draft indicators**: Commits with WIP, fixup, squash, tmp, todo, hack, draft, or similar markers will be rejected

### Examples

```
cmake: fix build issue with shaderc detection
VkVideoDecoder: add support for AV1 profile
docs: update build instructions for Fedora
ci: add commit message validation workflow
```

### Validation

Commit messages are automatically validated on pull requests via commitlint. See `commitlint.config.js` for the full ruleset.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When opening a pull request, you'll be presented with a template. Please fill in all required sections.

### PR Title

The PR title must follow the same format as commit messages:

```
scope: description
```

- Same scope rules apply (lowercase for areas, PascalCase for components)
- Maximum 100 characters
- No draft indicators (WIP, fixup, etc.)
- Must not end with a period

### Required Sections

#### Description

Describe your changes clearly. Explain the "why" behind the changes, not just the "what".

#### Type of Change

Specify one of: `bug fix` / `feature` / `refactor` / `docs` / `cleanup`

#### Tests

Every PR must include test results from the [testing framework](tests/README.md). This helps maintainers understand the test coverage and identify potential hardware-specific issues.

**Required format:**

```
### [GPU Model] / [Driver Version] / [OS]

Total Tests: 70
Passed: 48
Failed: 0
Success Rate: 100.0%
```

**Required fields** (validated by CI):
- `Total Tests`
- `Passed`
- `Failed`
- `Success Rate`
- GPU / Driver / OS header line

**Optional fields** (not validated, but recommended):
- `Crashed`
- `Not Supported`
- `Skipped`

This information is essential for tracking codec support across different hardware vendors and driver versions.

### Optional Sections

#### Issue

Link related issues using GitHub keywords:
- `Fixes #123` - closes the issue when PR is merged
- `Related to #456` - references without closing

#### Additional Details

Use this section for any extra context that doesn't fit elsewhere:
- Implementation notes or trade-offs
- Performance considerations
- Migration or upgrade notes
- Screenshots or logs
- Links to related discussions or documentation

### Validation

PR titles and bodies are automatically validated via GitHub Actions. The check will fail if required sections are missing or incorrectly formatted.

## Release Process

1. Update `Changelog.md` with the new version entry
2. Update the version in `common/include/VkVSCommon.h`
3. Create a tag (e.g. `v0.4.0`) and push it — GitHub will automatically create a release
